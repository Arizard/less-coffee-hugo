## Glossy Top Coats

When photographing glossy nails with a softbox or bounce, you might find that there is an annoying white streak obscuring the nail art. I've been calling this "glare".

It took me a frustratingly long time to learn that the glare is only visible on the camera because the softbox is orders of magnitude brighter than the environment. This became an optimisation problem:

1. Use the speedlight to add enough illumination to the scene to get sufficient exposure for `1/250s -- 1/100s` `f/8` `ISO 200 -- 400`.
2. Ensure that there is not a single concentrated bright spot which has greater illumination than the environment.

My solution (which still needs work) is to set the speedlight to maximum power, point the softbox at the ceiling, and take the shot. This way, I could vary the height of the softbox to control the size of the illuminated area of the ceiling: lower softbox means bigger spread, with less resulting power.

After I implemented this solution, I observed that the relative brightness of the glare was much lower compared to the rest of the nail art.
