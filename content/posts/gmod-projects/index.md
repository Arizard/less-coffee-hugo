When I was in high school and early university, I loved the game [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/). It was the community where I worked on my first major personal projects - some of which generated my first ever income. Many are still in use!

The following is a collection of my works spanning 2014 -- 2018.

## Deathrun Neue (Open Source)

Deathrun Neue is a batteries-included Deathrun gamemode for Garry's Mod. Players are divided into two teams: Runners and Deaths. Runners must complete an obstacle course, while Deaths activate traps to stop them.

Features:

* Pointshop support
* Mapvote with RTV
* Button claiming
* Player-defined custom crosshair
* Death avoidance punishments
* Start and end zones
* Map completion timer and leaderboard

## Sauke (Unreleased)

Sauke is a projectile weapon free-for-all deathmatch gamemode. Players use rockets and grenades to propel themselves across the map, employing skill-based movement (surfing and bunnyhopping), in order to frag opponents.

Beautiful custom maps were created for this gamemode by Zelpa.

## bodyGroupr (Paid)

bodyGroupr is an addon for the Garry's Mod gamemode DarkRP. It provides a user interface and in-game objects that allow players to customise the appearance of their in-game avatar.

## RedactedHub (Private)

RedactedHub is a multi-purpose server hub which I created for my gaming community. Players can purchase in-game wearable items using in-game points earned through playing on the server.

Features:

* Purchase and sell in-game items
* Transfer items to other players
* Preview in-game avatar
* Jukebox (play music in-game, using YouTube)
* Finite quantity of each item (creates stable value of in-game items)
* Finite quantity of in-game points (prevents inflation)

## doorHandle (Paid)

doorHandle adds configurable signage to in-game doors in the DarkRP gamemode. Players can configure size, colour and font through a graphical user interface.

## PerkShop (Paid)

PerkShop is a points-based in-game shop for items which augment player movement, health, damage, and damage resistance. Players purchase _perks_ using in-game points, which can be combined or stacked for unique effects.
