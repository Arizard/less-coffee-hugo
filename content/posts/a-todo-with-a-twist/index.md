My personal organisation skills always had room to improve. They still do!

This article explains an approach I've been using to manage day-to-day tasks,
and some challenges I've faced in my first 11 months as a software engineer.

In a way, I wish I could have shown this to myself 11 months ago.

## Managing ephemeral personal tasks

You're always going to get given work that exists solely through emails and
Slack messages. Sometimes, you might even have an idea for a creative solution
while in the shower (I have _showerthoughts_ all the time!). These are what I
call _ephemeral tasks_.

This work must be _consolidated_ into one place, to be _tracked_ and
_prioritised_ until completion. These three pillars help guide any task to
completion.

- Work that is not consolidated and solidified will vanish into the aether.
  There needs to be concrete record of a task's existence.
- Work that is not tracked effectively will result in unpleasant surprises down
  the track, [and this always happens at the worst possible time.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law).
  It's critical to have visibility of your own capacity.
- Work that is not prioritised effectively can't be delivered in a timely
  manner. The impact of ineffective prioritisation is financial (loss of
  revenue) and cultural (loss of reputation).

The method used has to be simple as well - personal organisation consumes
_emotional energy_. This energy needs needs to be saved for critical decision
making.

## Use a kanban-style to-do list to prioritise personal tasks

If you've heard of [Personal Kanban]() this is the same thing.

To do this, I use [Notion](https://notion.so) and keep a **personal kanban
board** with only 3 columns. This different to the typical **binary to-do
list** and provides a little more granularity of task status which helps with
prioritisation.

1. Back Burner
2. Front Burner
3. Done

The **Back Burner** is for work that I am not currently working on.

The **Front Burner** is for work that is _urgent_ - usually this means I am
currently working on it.

**Done** is for completed work.

When work is sent to me, depending on the _urgency_, it is put into either Back Burner
or Front Burner.

## Work from many sources is consolidated

This method allows me to consolidate work from any source. I can also add work
at any time or from any place as this board can be accessed from a mobile device.

Yes, even when I'm in the shower, if I have a brainwave I can note it down
immediately.

Any work that needs to be completed is instantly solidified, even if I don't work
on it right away.

## Personal capacity is accurately reported

> What are you working on today, Arie?

The amount of work assigned to me depends on my answer to this question.

Keeping track of all ephemeral tasks this way helps me give _honest and
accurate_ reports of my capacity for a given day or week. This is important
when setting expectations with your teammates on when tasks can be completed.

## Urgent work is prioritised

It takes little effort to shuffle tasks between Back Burner and Front Burner.

Front Burner gives a good overview of the urgent work for the week, and allows
me to focus.

Day to day, I can pick up where I left off based on the contents
of the Front Burner column.

Urgent work is delivered in a timely manner, and
does not rely on there being an official record.

## Further

Here are some links that might help you get started with a personal kanban board
like the one in this article:

- [Introduction to Personal Kanban (6:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG6IDTHJ-bg) - fantastic introduction to the benefits of using Kanban.
- [How To Use Kanban To Become Insanely Productive](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryancollinseurope/2018/07/19/how-to-use-kanban-to-become-insanely-productive-a-short-guide/#3b728ffb3c16)
- [Trello (free board-list-card tool)](https://trello.com/en)

Try managing your work with a personal kanban board - you can relax knowing that
this board is only for you, and you can define your own rules to get maximum
benefit from this technique.
