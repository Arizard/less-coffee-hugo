## For Software Engineering

### Clean Architecture (Robert Martin)

<span class="status orange">in progress</span>

The book every engineer should read at the beginning of their career.
Covered within are the SOLID principles and how to design architectural 
components. 

Crucial for building large systems which are resilient
during changing requirements.

**UPDATE**: After reading some opinions from other engineers about this book, it
might be mostly BS - at least the SOLID parts. Putting this one down for now. 

### Microservices Patterns (Chris Richardson)

<span class="status orange">in progress</span>

This book is an encyclopedia of well-known and lesser-known microservice
design patterns. It would be good for personal study, as the chapters
explain concepts very thoroughly (sometimes repetitively).

If you're starting a new job in a business that uses
any kind of service oriented architecture, this will be a useful
reference.

### 97 Principles for Software Architects (multiple authors)

<span class="status green">finished reading</span>

This book contains 97 axioms from software architecture practitioners,
including warnings, lessons, cautionary tales, advice, and humor. I have the audiobook version, and it's great to listen to during a commute and absorb the knowledge that comes with decades of experience.

Each chapter is bite-sized, and it's easy to consume multiple chapters in
one sitting. This book might change your perspective on software 
engineering work!

### The Phoenix Project (Gene Kim)

<span class="status green">finished reading</span>

An entertaining, gripping story about corporate IT, operations, DevOps and
business politics. This book will teach you about the fictional DevOps 
transformation of _Parts Unlimited_ as the company struggles to stay 
afloat in a digital market.

If you've ever worked corporate and felt like the IT systems are actually hindering your ability to work, this book will be very relatable.

## For Business

### Reimagining Capitalism In A World On Fire (Rebecca Henderson)

<span class="status orange">in progress</span>

Henderson puts forward a new framework for the way businesses should operate - a framework which simultaneously has a positive societal and environmental impact, and creates shareholder value. 

This book has shaped the way I think about corporations, and now I believe all businesses have a social and environmental duty of care - towards employees, customers, suppliers, and the planet.

### Inspired (Marty Cagan)

## For Personal Development

### Atomic Habits (James Clear)

<span class="status orange">in progress</span>

As it turns out, humans are very predictable organisms. In his book, Clear explains the science behind human behaviour and routine forming, and why certain habits are hard to create, and others are hard to break. He introduces the concept of a 4-step model for any given habit: Cue, Craving, Response, Reward. Interrupting the model at any step will help to break the habit. You can even substitute what happens at a particular step, in order to create new habits out of existing ones - this is called *habit stacking*. 

Great book if you're looking to start building routines into your day.

### Ikigai (Héctor García and Francesc Miralles)

<span class="status green">finished reading</span>

An *ikigai* is your reason for getting out of bed in the morning. This book investigates the lifestyles of some of Japan's oldest human residents, and in particular, tries to determine what actions, beliefs and values these individuals hold which allow them to live long and happy lives. 

This comforting book inspires readers to prioritise healthy habits, shrug off the small stuff, and find ones own purpose.

### Dare To Lead (Brené Brown)

### Never Split The Difference (Chris Voss)

## Fiction

### 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea (Jules Verne)

<span class="status orange">in progress</span>

Prior to purchasing a copy of this book, I had not read any fiction books since year 12. I chose this one for it's steampunk appeal. The story is narrated from the perspective of Pierre Aronnax as he kept prisoner on the submarine *Nautilus* by Captain Nemo. 

Most interesting is the descriptions of technology used aboard the *Nautilus*, which is not dissimilar to technology we have today, over 150 years after publishing. For example, electric submarines, diving suits, airlocks, ballast tanks, and use of compressed air to stay submerged for long periods of time.
