## For Software Engineering

### Clean Architecture (Robert Martin)

<span class="status orange">in progress</span>

The book every engineer should read at the beginning of their career.
Covered within are the SOLID principles and how to design architectural 
components. Crucial for building large systems which are resilient
during changing requirements.

### Microservices Patterns (Chris Richardson)

<span class="status orange">in progress</span>

This book is an encyclopedia of well-known and lesser-known microservice
design patterns. If you're starting a new job in a business that uses
any kind of service-oriented architecture, this will be a useful
reference. It would also be good for personal study, as the chapters
explain concepts very thoroughly (sometimes repetitively).

### 97 Principles for Software Architects (multiple authors)

<span class="status green">finished reading</span>

This book contains 97 axioms from software architecture practitioners,
including warnings, lessons, cautionary tales, advice, and humor. I have the audiobook version, and it's great to listen to during a commute
and absorb the knowledge that comes with decades of experience.
Each chapter is bite-sized, and it's easy to consume multiple chapters in
one sitting. This book might change your perspective on software 
engineering work!

### The Phoenix Project (Gene Kim)

<span class="status green">finished reading</span>

An entertaining, gripping story about corporate IT, operations, DevOps and
business politics. This book will teach you about the fictional DevOps 
transformation of _Parts Unlimited_ as the company struggles to stay 
afloat in a digital market.
