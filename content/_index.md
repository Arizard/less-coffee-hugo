I'm Arie. I'm a software engineer. I have loved writing code since I was a teenager, and I have a bachelor's degree in telecommunications engineering.

My first proper software role started in 2019 at [Deputy](https://deputy.com).

Now I'm inlining functions at [Eucalyptus](https://eucalyptus.health).

On this blog you'll find more than just software engineering content, however. It's really just a place to publish whatever I feel like, such as photography or opinions. You can also [check out my gallery](/gallery/) to see photos I've taken.
