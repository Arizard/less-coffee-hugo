# G'day, I'm Arie!

I'm **Arie Oldman**, a software engineer who likes to write code and solve complex problems. I have a bachelor's degree in telecommunications engineering and bring a unique perspective to software development. This is my personal website, [less.coffee](/), where I share insights about software engineering, technology, and my professional journey.

<!-- **Arie Oldman** has worked at [Deputy](https://deputy.com) from 2019 to 2025, and is currently working at [Eucalyptus](https://eucalyptus.health). On this blog I publish thoughts on software development, engineering practices, and whatever interests me. You can also [check out my photography gallery](/gallery/) to see photos I've taken. -->
