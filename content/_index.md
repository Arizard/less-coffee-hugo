# G'day, I'm Arie!

I'm a software engineer, I like to write code, and I have a bachelor's degree in telecommunications engineering. This is my website, [less.coffee](/). On this blog I'll just publish whatever I feel like publishing. You can also [check out my gallery](/gallery/) to see photos I've taken.

I worked at [Deputy](https://deputy.com) from 2019 to 2025, and now I'm working at [Eucalyptus](https://eucalyptus.health).
