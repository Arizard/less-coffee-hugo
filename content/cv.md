## Projects

### <span>Deputy Export Aggregator</span> <span>Deputy, 2020 -- 2021</span>

A service which periodically collects data from one or more Deputy 
instances and then collates and combines the data into a single file. The file 
is submitted via SFTP to a configurable destination server.

Original use case is aggregating schedule data across multiple Qantas accounts,
then submitting the file to Qantas via SFTP to be consumed by GroundStar 
RealTime.

Considerations made to account for future extension and re-use with other
accounts.

Created with Go, AWS Lambda and AWS CloudWatch.

### <span>Deputy Environment Variables Custom App</span> <span>Deputy, 2020</span>

A Deputy custom app to provide a configuration GUI for account-scoped variables 
used within Decaf/DeXML scripts.

A repeated anti-pattern within the CX team is the practice of including
account-specific configuration in scripts. This project provides a standard
approach to avoiding this anti-pattern.

Solution consultants can change configuration variables as frequently as the
customer's requirements change.

Created with Vue and Decaf.

### <span>Bunnings AU 2013 EBA</span> <span>Deputy, 2020</span> {#bunnings}

Designed and implemented _Bunnings - Bank Of Hours_ features in the Bunnings
Australia account.

* Engineer a solution to keep a ledger recording the difference between 
  worked and contracted hours per employee per 52-week period.
* Design award interpretation for _Bank Of Hours_. Ensure employees are paid
  correctly based on the discrepancy between worked and contracted hours 
  (a.k.a Overtime)
* Build graphical interfaces in Vue to manage, report, export, and view 
  _Bank Of Hours_ information.
* Build HTTP endpoints to allow Bunnings to import historic _Bank Of Hours_ 
  data.

Designed and implemented _Bunnings - Public Holiday Not Worked_ features in
the Bunnings Australia account:

* Engineer a solution to allow employees to receive conditional pay for 
  public holidays which they were not rostered.
* Build HTTP endpoints to allow Bunnings to import historic work data (Work
  istory) which drives the conditional Public Holiday Not Worked pay.

### <span>Precaf</span> <span>Deputy, 2020</span> {#precaf}

Precaf is a command line tool to automate bundling and deployment of Decaf
scripts. 

As part of this project, a library of common functions was co-developed for
the team to use (similar to a Standard Library).

Created with Go.

### <span>Less Coffee</span> <span>2020 -- present</span>

Less Coffee is a personal website used to publish a web resum√© and a project
portfolio. It is a static site hosted on S3, served over HTTPS using CloudFront.
It is deployed automatically via a GitHub Action which executes on any commit
to the master git branch.

### <span>Tetra</span> <span>Deputy, 2019</span> {#tetra}

Tetra is a service to pre-process incoming CSV files using a sequence of
standard transformations, such as slice rows, apply title case, convert date 
format, or merge two columns.

### <span>ScriptEngine 1 and 2</span> <span>2019</span>

An online platform for instructors to organise group fitness class 
plans (scripts) by following a specific format.

* Implemented the user interface using React with the blueprintjs component 
  library, with Firebase as the authentication provider.
* Implemented the application middleware using Go and Cloud Firestore as the 
  database provider.
* Rewrite from scratch using TypeScript in V2, adding improvements to appearance 
  and drag-and-drop using react-beautiful-dnd.

### <span>Video Game Modding</span> <span>2016 -- 2018</span> {#gmod}

and doorHandle addons for Garry‚Äôs Mod. Written in Lua, available on GitHub and 
[GmodStore](https://www.gmodstore.com/teams/18/addons).

## Education

### <span>Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Telecommunications Engineering</span> <span>2015 -- 2018</span> {#degree}

**Inline DDoS Detection for SMB**

Protected a simulated network against denial of service attacks by writing an SDN controller middleware with Python to integrate Openflow and the Bro Intrusion Detection System.

<!--
[^tesseract]: Tesseract is a suite of automated Lambda services which enable Deputy integration with external HR systems using a CSV file. Tesseract is used when performance with Decaf becomes an issue due to a large number of rows in the CSV.
[^decaf]: Decaf is a programming language which resembles CoffeeScript. It is used inside a Deputy instance to provide scripting functionality. Internally, it is transpiled into DeXML and then interpreted using PHP.
[^precaf]: Precaf is a Decaf developer tool which renders a code template and then deploys the code to a Deputy instance.
[^tetra-processor-private]: The Lambda service, _Tetra Processor_ is a private repository.
[^example-awards-nsw]: See the following for an example of the industry and occupation awards listed by Fair Work NSW: https://www.fairwork.gov.au/awards-and-agreements/awards/list-of-awards
[^boh]: The Bank Of Hours is a process used within Bunnings which aims to provide flexible working arrangements to staff while maintaining a required number of contract hours per year. Staff can enter "debt" or "surplus" for their Bank Of Hours balance, which is then either paid to the employee at the end of the Bank Of Hours year (as overtime) or deducted from the employee's pay.
[^phnw]: Certain staff members at Bunnings are eligible to be paid for public holidays where they are not rostered on.
[^evca]: The Environment Variables Custom App provides a means of accessing account-scoped variables within Decaf/DeXML scripts. The values of these variables can be configured through the Environment Variables Custom App. This allows non-technical staff at Deputy to configure the account in ways they could not before.
[^bunnings]: The Bunnings account is a Deputy Enterprise account with over 50,000 active users.
