I'm Arie, and less.coffee is my personal website.

It's built with the Hugo static site generator, using a theme I created called `etch-less-coffee`. It's named that way because it was originally a fork of the etch theme—barely anything remains now.

Comments are powered by my own comment server called `gomments`. Names can be followed by a `#` symbol and some free text, which generates a tripcode and renders your comment with one of sixteen colours.

My favorite part about this website is that the pages are served via a Cloudfront distribution backed by S3. It would be cheap if not for the compute required to host `gomments`.

Now, [go back to the index and read something, please]( {{< ref "/" >}} ).
