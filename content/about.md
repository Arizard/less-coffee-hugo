My name is Arie - I'm a software developer based in Sydney. I started this blog to write about topics that I'm studying - whether that be for my job or just for personal interest. The goal is to improve my written communication skills while solidifying my knowledge.

I'm working as a software engineer providing professional services at Deputy, developing platform customisations for enterprise customers.

This blog is built with Hugo using the Noteworthy theme.
