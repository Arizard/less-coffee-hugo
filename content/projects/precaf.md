_Precaf_ is a build-and-deploy tool used internally at Deputy. It provides a means for Decaf developers to standardise and automate the re-use of code snippets among teams. _Precaf_ was developed for the _2020_ _Love Bugs Hackathon_ at Deputy.

## Problem Statement

### Decaf and DeXML

DeXML is a scripting language layered on top of the Deputy core product (written in PHP). This feature enables custom behaviour to be implemented on a per-account basis. This professional service is carried out by the Customer Experience (CX) teams within each region.
