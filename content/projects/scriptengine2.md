<div style="display: none">
    The improved edition of ScriptEngine - using TypeScript, React Hooks, React Contexts, Blueprint and React Beautiful DND.
</div>

ScriptEngine 2 helps instructors plan their classes to create life-changing fitness experiences.

It is the second version of ScriptEngine with a completely new codebase.

* **TypeScript** instead of plain JavaScript for type safety and stricter interfaces.
* **React function components** instead of React class components - they are simpler to reason about.
* **React hooks** instead of class state - again, this is easier to reason about and separate state concerns within a component.
* **React contexts** to share state among many components, avoiding passing props down the component tree and avoiding using a library such as Redux (which affected performance when it was included).
* More idiomatic usage of **Blueprint** component library according to the documentation.
* **React-Beautiful-DND** to manage interactive lists and improve usability when re-arranging rows in a script.
* Improvements to the UX based on user feedback.

ScriptEngine 2 is live at: [script.less.coffee](http://script.less.coffee).
