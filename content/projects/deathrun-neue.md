## Overview

<p><img src="/images/deathrun-neue-screenshot-01.png" width="100%" alt="Screenshot of Deathrun Neue"/></p>


Deathrun is a _Garry's Mod_ gamemode which involves two teams - Runners and Deaths - and a series of elaborate traps. 

The Runners must dodge, bait, and distract in order to avoid certain death and complete the course. The Deaths must do whatever they can to prevent the Runners from achieving their goal.

**Deathrun Neue** is a comprehensive, feature-rich Deathrun gamemode created by Arizard with the help of testers such as Zelpa, Impetulio, Baksus (and the Redline Gaming community) and A Faceless Baby. 

## Features

This gamemode comes standard with many popular Deathrun features - such as **thirdperson mode**, **pointshop support** (PS 1, PS 2), **AFK timers**, and a nominate/rtv **mapvote system**. The gamemode also includes lesser-known features, such as **automatic button claiming**, **custom crosshairs**, **death avoidance punishments**, and **trigger zones**.

## Customisation

The gamemode also has a focus on customisability, featuring various client-side convars for each player's unique tastes, and also serverside convars to allow owners customize their server's gameplay.

Hooks are also available to let developers customise gamemode behaviour.

## Motivation

<!-- dissatisfaction with existing gamemodes -->
### Dissatisfaction with Existing Gamemodes

As a player who was also managing my own servers, I was dissapointed with the current offering of deathrun gamemodes. There were three main gamemodes available - two free, one paid. 

All three of these gamemodes had poor customisation support and required a significant amount of boilerplate work to get a server up and running.

In addition, these gamemodes were not keeping up to date with the latest trends in the deathrun community - auto-bunnyhop, pointshops, mapvote systems were all becoming standard. 

<!-- desire to come together and create something unique -->
### The Desire to Come Together

Once you settle into a gaming community, the players around you become like family. 

Our VHS-7 family was formed around the desire to express our unapologetic uniqueness as a gaming community through the way we administrate our servers and the content we offer to players.

Deathrun Neue was the biggest project we had ever taken on as a community - the gamemode's success could not have been achieved if not for the countless testing hours and feedback messages that our family provided.

In creating Deathrun Neue, VHS-7 had come together to build something unique and change the deathrun status quo that had been maintained for years. 

<!-- desire to improve the deathrun community as a whole -->
### Improving the Community as a Whole

Creating a new deathrun server for you and your friends should be fast and easy, with minimal configuration required.

Existing gamemodes required a lot of boilerplate work, depending on external addons which required further configuration.

For example, Mr. Gash's Deathrun (the most widely used) required a manual installation of another addon to provide in-game weapons, and then needed configuration to use those weapons with the gamemode.

If Deathrun Neue came bundled with all this extra boilerplate, it would be a no-brainer to install this on a brand new server.

This is the reason Deathrun Neue comes packed with configurable features, which default to the commonly accepted trends of the community.

## Fast Forward to Today

Deathrun Neue is a widely used deathrun gamemode, valued for it's simple installation and first-class support for popular and useful features.

The gamemode is free and open-source. Supporters can "purchase" the gamemode on [GmodStore](https://gmodstore.com) to support the developer, but it is completely optional.

VHS-7 (now officially inactive) still has a Deathrun server operated by one of the most tenured staff members of the original community, running the original codebase.
