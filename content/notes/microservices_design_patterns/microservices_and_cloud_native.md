## Cloud Native

* It's an **architectural style**
* It primarily facilitates operating inside a cloud.
* Can be defined[^12fad].
* Focus on portable and scalable applications. Deploy or move applications anywhere globally and they still work without additional code. Replicate services to handle additional load.
* Can be run in a single datacenter.

## Microservices

* Small scoped **units of work**. 
* Focus on the data, business, or function domains.
* **Not** monolithic service artifacts.

## Microservices and Cloud Native Go Together!

* Scalability
* Can run one without the other
* Distinct concepts, often considered the same. They are not.
