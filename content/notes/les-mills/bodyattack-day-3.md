## Warmup

* Only include the **most important layer 2** cues, since there isn't much time.
The most important are often the simplest.
* **Set up your connection in the warmup** - Motivate using connection to the 
moves, music and people **within the first track**. This creates more connection throughout
the class and brings the participants along for the class journey.

## Mixed Impact

* Include more layer 1 **BPD + muscle groups**
    * e.g. _Step feet wide_ -- _Bend your knees_
* Include more layer 2 BPD + muscle groups, and also **how to control intensity**
    * This can be achieved by coaching **how** and **why** for a move. Coach how to
    increase intensity:
    > _drive harder through the floor_ 
      
    and then immediately explain why
    
    > to jump higher
     
    > _Hips down lower_ - _to work the glutes_.
     
    * It can also be simpler: _Run **further** forward_
* Make sure to include **move names**.

## Interval

* Don't stand still at the start of the track.
* There are 3 distinct peaks of energy. Instead of starting at gear 1 and gradually
increasing through the whole track, try going up gears in each energy peak.
    * gear 1, gear 1.5, gear 2
    * gear 1, gear 2, gear 2.5
    * gear 2, gear 2, gear 2.5
* Include simple cues which get the participants moving **bigger**.


## General Feedback

* BA movements have a _relaxed energy_ to them - contrast this to BS where the 
aerobic movements are very sharp and defined. Lisa (on video) is very bouncy, somewhat loose
in her movements, and this is part of the BA essence.
* **Layer 2 Recap** - make sure to include **how** to control intensity on top of
coaching a harder move.
* Contrast movement using **gears** - the biggest moves happen during the highest-gear 
parts of the track. Making a move as big as possible shows enjoyment and engages/excites
the participants, creating and emotional experience.
* Use **time cues** to give participants control over the intensity.
    > _10 seconds left_
    
    > _8 reps left_
    
    > _block 3 of 3_
* Floor time is added to connect with the class in a different way. Use the floor
time in BA to connect and engage. Get close to participants and work with them
at "eye level".
* **More ROM!!!** to make the moves and energy stand out. Don't hold back! A larger ROM in
peaks of the track will inspire and motivate.

## Next Steps

* Regular filming and review.
* Develop layer 2 and 3 cues further.
* Work on vocal drive and contrast for the peaks within each track. Find a bigger "big" voice
to match the great lower voice used.
