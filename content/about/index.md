**Hi, I'm Arie** - I love programming and software development so much that I made it my career. This website contains a broad range of content topics - some articles are about software engineering, others might be about productivity or human interactions, and occasionally I write about fitness.

I'm working as a software engineer at [Deputy](https://deputy.com), developing platform customisations for enterprise customers.

I hope you find this website useful and interesting. You can get in touch with me via the comments on this page, or [send me an email](mailto:arie.oldman@vhs7.tv).

Thanks for your visit!
