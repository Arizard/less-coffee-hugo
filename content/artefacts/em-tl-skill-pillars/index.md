| Navigating ambiguity & setting direction | High | High | Both |
| Cross-team coordination & alignment | High | High | Both |

## Communication & influence
**L1:** Writing a design doc that shifts team consensus, or getting buy-in from a skeptical senior engineer without escalating.

**L2:** Proactively shaping technical direction before a decision point arrives. Others reference your writing when onboarding or making decisions months later.

## Clear, actionable feedback
**L1:** Telling someone exactly which decision was wrong, why, and what you'd do instead. Every point backed by a concrete example.

**L2:** Feedback that changes how someone thinks permanently. They start catching the same issues themselves and pass the standard on to others.


## Identifying & unblocking bottlenecks
**L1:** Noticing the PR queue is backing up and proposing a rotation or review SLA. Spotting systemic drag before it becomes a complaint.

**L2:** Tracing the bottleneck to root cause and proposing a structural fix — not just a band-aid process change.

## Delegating effectively
**L1:** Breaking down a complex task into something a junior can own, then resisting the urge to take it back when they do it differently than you would.

**L2:** Delegating the outcome, not the task. They own the problem end-to-end, make calls you'd have made differently, and still ship something you're proud to have sponsored.

## Understanding people's strengths & motivations
**L1:** Pattern recognition over time — noticing what lights someone up, where they drag their feet, what they avoid volunteering for.

**L2:** Knowing what someone needs to grow before they do — proactively putting them in situations that stretch them in the right direction.

## Technical credibility
**L1:** Being the person teams consult before making an architectural decision, even when you're not on their team.

**L2:** Other teams adjust their roadmap or architecture based on your input. You're brought in early, not as a reviewer at the end.

## Navigating ambiguity
**L1:** Being handed a vague problem and scoping it yourself — deciding what success looks like and driving it without being told how.

**L2:** Defining success criteria, getting stakeholder alignment on them, and delivering without check-ins. Others use your approach as a template.

## Cross-team coordination & alignment
**L1:** Getting two teams with competing priorities to agree on a shared interface or timeline without a manager forcing it.

**L2:** Identifying misalignment before it becomes a conflict and resolving it at the working level — so it never needs to escalate to managers at all.

## Key takeaways
- TL and EM share most of the same underlying skills — divergence is about **where you spend your time**, not what you're capable of.
- Hardest to develop without explicit opportunity: **navigating ambiguity** and **cross-team alignment** — push for broader scope to build these.
- L2 across the board = your standard is **repeatable and teachable without you being present**.
