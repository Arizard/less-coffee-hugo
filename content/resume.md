## Education

{{< annotatedH3 "Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)" "2019, Major in Telecommunications Engineering" >}}
{{< resumeTagGroup "Software Defined Networks" "Python" "Openflow" >}}

**Inline DDoS Detection for SMB**

Protected a simulated network against denial of service attacks by writing an SDN controller middleware with Python to integrate Openflow and the Bro Intrusion Detection System.

[^tesseract]: Tesseract is a suite of automated Lambda services which enable Deputy integration with external HR systems using a CSV file. Tesseract is used when performance with Decaf becomes an issue due to a large number of rows in the CSV.
[^decaf]: Decaf is a programming language which resembles CoffeeScript. It is used inside a Deputy instance to provide scripting functionality. Internally, it is transpiled into DeXML and then interpreted using PHP.
[^precaf]: Precaf is a Decaf developer tool which renders a code template and then deploys the code to a Deputy instance.
[^tetra-processor-private]: The Lambda service, _Tetra Processor_ is a private repository.
[^example-awards-nsw]: See the following for an example of the industry and occupation awards listed by Fair Work NSW: https://www.fairwork.gov.au/awards-and-agreements/awards/list-of-awards
[^boh]: The Bank Of Hours is a process used within Bunnings which aims to provide flexible working arrangements to staff while maintaining a required number of contract hours per year. Staff can enter "debt" or "surplus" for their Bank Of Hours balance, which is then either paid to the employee at the end of the Bank Of Hours year (as overtime) or deducted from the employee's pay.
[^phnw]: Certain staff members at Bunnings are eligible to be paid for public holidays where they are not rostered on.
[^evca]: The Environment Variables Custom App provides a means of accessing account-scoped variables within Decaf/DeXML scripts. The values of these variables can be configured through the Environment Variables Custom App. This allows non-technical staff at Deputy to configure the account in ways they could not before.
[^bunnings]: The Bunnings account is a Deputy Enterprise account with over 50,000 active users.
