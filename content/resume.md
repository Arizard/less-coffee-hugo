## Projects

{{< annotatedH3 "Precaf" "Deputy, 2020 to present" >}}
{{< resumeTagGroup "Go" "CoffeeScript (Decaf)" "Hackathon" >}}

- Created the Precaf[^precaf] developer tool using Go.
- Co-developed a new standard library of common procedures for CX Engineering.
- Overcame many issues that exist in using Decaf[^decaf] as the main programming language for customer scripts (code reuse, standard library of procedures, manual deployment to instance, code readability, code review).
- Create quick start guides and documentation for Precaf and standard procedures.

{{< annotatedH3 "Less Coffee" "2020 to present" >}}
{{< resumeTagGroup "Hugo" "AWS" "Web" >}}

- Created Less Coffee - a personal website built with Hugo to publish a resum√© and occasional articles.
- Implemented an automatic deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions and AWS S3.
- Secured static website with HTTPS using AWS CloudFront and Route 53.

{{< annotatedH3 "Tetra" "Deputy, 2019" >}}
{{< resumeTagGroup "Go" "AWS Lambda" "Integration" >}}

- Created a Lambda application to pre-process incoming CSV files using a series of transformations (e.g. slice rows, apply titlecase to column, merge two columns, omit a row depending on value)
- Overcame a drawback with Tesseract[^tesseract] integration from external HR systems (e.g. _Frontier Chris21_). Incoming CSV files were incompatible with Tesseract until they were transformed using Tetra.
- Overcame an issue with the development agility of Tesseract by separating Tetra features into an independent service.

{{< annotatedH3 "ScriptEngine 1 and 2" "2019 to present" >}}
{{< resumeTagGroup "JavaScript" "React" "TypeScript" >}}

-   Created an online platform for instructors to organise group fitness class plans (scripts) by following a specific format.
-   Implemented the user interface using React with the `blueprintjs` component library, with Firebase as the authentication provider.
-   Implemented the application middleware using Go and Cloud Firestore as the database provider.
- Rewrite from scratch using TypeScript in V2, adding improvements to appearance and drag-and-drop using `react-beautiful-dnd`.

## Training

-   Optus IPv6 In Practice (Singtel Optus, 2017)
-   Optus TCP/IP In Practice (Singtel Optus, 2015)

[^tesseract]: Tesseract is a suite of automated Lambda services which enable Deputy integration with external HR systems using a CSV file. Tesseract is used when performance with Decaf becomes an issue due to a large number of rows in the CSV.

[^decaf]: Decaf is a programming language which resembles CoffeeScript. It is used inside a Deputy instance to provide scripting functionality. Internally, it is transpiled into DeXML and then interpreted using PHP.

[^precaf]: Precaf is a Decaf developer tool which renders a code template and then deploys the code to a Deputy instance.

[^tetra-processor-private]: The Lambda service, _Tetra Processor_ is a private repository.

[^example-awards-nsw]: See the following for an example of the industry and occupation awards listed by Fair Work NSW: https://www.fairwork.gov.au/awards-and-agreements/awards/list-of-awards

[^boh]: The Bank Of Hours is a process used within Bunnings which aims to provide flexible working arrangements to staff while maintaining a required number of contract hours per year. Staff can enter "debt" or "surplus" for their Bank Of Hours balance, which is then either paid to the employee at the end of the Bank Of Hours year (as overtime) or deducted from the employee's pay.

[^phnw]: Certain staff members at Bunnings are eligible to be paid for public holidays where they are not rostered on.

[^evca]: The Environment Variables Custom App provides a means of accessing account-scoped variables within Decaf/DeXML scripts. The values of these variables can be configured through the Environment Variables Custom App. This allows non-technical staff at Deputy to configure the account in ways they could not before.
