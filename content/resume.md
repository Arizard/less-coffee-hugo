    (a.k.a Overtime)
  * Build graphical interfaces in **Vue** to manage, report, export, and view 
    _Bank Of Hours_ information.
  * Build HTTP endpoints to allow Bunnings to import historic _Bank Of Hours_

Designed and implemented _Bunnings - Public Holiday Not Worked_ features in
the Bunnings Australia account:
    
  * Engineer a solution to allow employees to receive conditional pay for 
    public holidays which they were not rostered.
  * Build HTTP endpoints to allow Bunnings to import historic work data (Work
    History) which drives the conditional Public Holiday Not Worked pay.
    
Ongoing professional services engineering work and support engineering work:
    
  * Compass Group Australia, Compass Group New Zealand (Hospitality)
  * NRMA Marine, NRMA Parks and Resorts (Hospitality)
  * Challenger (Cleaning)
  * Living My Way (Disability Support)

* Created the Precaf developer tool using **Go**.
* Co-developed a new standard library for CX Engineering.
* Overcame many issues that exist in using Decaf as the main programming language for customer scripts (code reuse, standard library, manual deployment to instance, code readability, code review).
* Create documentation for Precaf and standard library.

### <span>Less Coffee</span> <span>2020 to present</span>

* Created Less Coffee - a personal website built with Hugo to publish a resum√© and occasional articles.
* Implemented an automatic deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions and AWS S3.
* Secured static website with HTTPS using AWS CloudFront and Route 53.

### <span>Tetra</span> <span>Deputy, 2019</span> {#tetra}

* Created a **Lambda** application to pre-process incoming CSV files using a series of transformations (e.g. slice rows, apply titlecase to column, merge two columns, omit a row depending on value)
* Overcame a drawback with Tesseract integration from external HR systems (e.g. _Frontier Chris21_). Incoming CSV files were incompatible with Tesseract until they were transformed using Tetra.
* Overcame an issue with the development agility of Tesseract by separating Tetra features into an independent service.

<!--
[^tesseract]: Tesseract is a suite of automated Lambda services which enable Deputy integration with external HR systems using a CSV file. Tesseract is used when performance with Decaf becomes an issue due to a large number of rows in the CSV.
[^decaf]: Decaf is a programming language which resembles CoffeeScript. It is used inside a Deputy instance to provide scripting functionality. Internally, it is transpiled into DeXML and then interpreted using PHP.
[^precaf]: Precaf is a Decaf developer tool which renders a code template and then deploys the code to a Deputy instance.
[^tetra-processor-private]: The Lambda service, _Tetra Processor_ is a private repository.
[^example-awards-nsw]: See the following for an example of the industry and occupation awards listed by Fair Work NSW: https://www.fairwork.gov.au/awards-and-agreements/awards/list-of-awards
[^boh]: The Bank Of Hours is a process used within Bunnings which aims to provide flexible working arrangements to staff while maintaining a required number of contract hours per year. Staff can enter "debt" or "surplus" for their Bank Of Hours balance, which is then either paid to the employee at the end of the Bank Of Hours year (as overtime) or deducted from the employee's pay.
[^phnw]: Certain staff members at Bunnings are eligible to be paid for public holidays where they are not rostered on.
[^evca]: The Environment Variables Custom App provides a means of accessing account-scoped variables within Decaf/DeXML scripts. The values of these variables can be configured through the Environment Variables Custom App. This allows non-technical staff at Deputy to configure the account in ways they could not before.
[^bunnings]: The Bunnings account is a Deputy Enterprise account with over 50,000 active users.
